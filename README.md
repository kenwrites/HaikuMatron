## What's this?

A website with silly haiku and limerick toys.  

## What's here? 

Complete:
- Home page
- Haphazard Haiku - spits out poems I've written, one at a time.
- The HaikuMatron - generates mildy-plausible haiku based on templates I've written combined with input from the user.  (think madlibs)

In progress:
- Better placement of poems, based on their character- and line-counts.
- More consistent button placement in HaikuMatron.  They jump around too much.  
- Add more templates to the HaikuMatron.  Single template gets old quickly.

Future: 
- Module to teach users how to write haiku
- Module to teach users how to write limericks

Fantasy:
- Module to analyze the syllable-structure of haiku and/or limericks written by users.  Use this as a pedagogical tool.  ( Not sure how to do this yet.  Ideas, resources, contributions welcome! )
