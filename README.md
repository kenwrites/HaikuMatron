## What's this?

A website with silly haiku and limerick toys.  

## What's here? 

Complete:
- Haphazard Haiku - spits out poems I've written, one at a time.

In progress:
- Home page 
- The HaikuMatron - generates mildy-plausible haiku based on templates and an array of words organized by number of syllables.

Future: 
- Module to teach users how to write haiku
- Module to teach users how to write limericks

Fantasy:
- Module to analyze the syllable-structure of haiku and/or limericks written by users.  Use this as a pedagogical tool.  ( Not sure how to do this yet.  Ideas, resources, contributions welcome! )
